Create two C++ programs to process sequence of values in two different ways:
1) with simple one way linked list using dynamical data structures,
2) using STL::list container.
In both realizations you should create specific function and use it. Print and input all values in
 list before and after processing.
In first realization with linked list you should also create list methods like add element and other.
 After usage of list you should correctly release memory (delete all list elements).

G10. Create list from values entered from keyboard. Enter one more value n.
Create function to delete next element after n if it exists and has different value from n.
If n appears in list several times then delete all elements followed after each n.
Example: List: 1 5 2 3 6 2 2 5 1 2. n=2 List after process: 1 5 2 6 2 2 1 2
